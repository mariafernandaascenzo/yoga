				I'm a 20-year-old certified yoga instructor who enjoys learning and stepping out of my comfort zone. Yoga has helped me find both. I decided to go online during lockdown to help people like you find a new conection between their mind and body, release some tension, and hopefully find peace within themselves during these stressful times.
